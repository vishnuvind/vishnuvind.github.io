I'm a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow (equivalent to pre-doctoral researcher) at the [Centre for Responsible AI](https://cerai.iitm.ac.in/) at **IIT Madras**, where I am supervised by [Prof. Krishna Pillutla](https://krishnap25.github.io/). Prior to this, I spent 5 wonderful years at IIT Madras earning my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science and Engineering, advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). My research interests lie primarily in the theory and practice of Trustworthy ML, with a focus on privacy-preserving and adversarially robust machine learning models. 

My research at CeRAI is centred around differentially private synthetic data generation using LLMs; some of my recent work was accepted at [NeurIPS 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02974). I am also currently exploring ways to extend this work to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as well as audit the privacy of LLM-generated synthetic text.

I was previously a Student Researcher at Google Research India, in the Advertising Sciences team, working on private offline reinforcment learning algorithms. I also spent an amazing summer at the University of British Columbia hosted by [Prof. Apurva Narayan](https://a-narayan.github.io/) where I explored the adversarial robustness of quantum ML models.

## News

* [October 2025] Some of my recent [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02974) on private text generation using LLMs was accepted at **NeurIPS 2025**. We introduce a highly scalable approach, InvisibleInk, which uses LLMs to generate synthetic text at scale with differential privacy guarantees, at **10x less computational cost** than prior work. Very grateful to [Prof. Krishna](https://krishnap25.github.io/) and [Abhradeep Thakurta](https://athakurta.squarespace.com/) for all their support and guidance!
* [October 2025] Our [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=2bj0eVgCdO) on "Preserving Expert-Level Privacy in Offline RL" was accepted in **TMLR**. Many thanks to my amazing collaborator [Navodita](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hcsR-tMAAAAJ) and our other collaborators at Google.
* [July 2024] I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the Centre for Responsible AI as a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow!
* [June 2024] I have graduated from the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering with a **Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)**. Thanks to everyone who made my time at IIT Madras truly special!
* [February 2024] Our [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08648), on "Generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Quantum Classifiers" was accepted at **AAAI 2024**. Thanks to my amazing collaborator [Gautham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautham-govind-a-8357211a7/), and to [Prof. Apurva](https://a-narayan.github.io/) for his guidance and support!
* [November 2023] Honoured to be selected as a **Student Researcher** at Google Research! I will be working on differentially private offline RL algorithms with folks from the Ad-Sciences team.
